# 📚 Online Book Store Analysis  

This project performs **data analysis on an online bookstore database** using **SQL**. The goal is to extract useful insights from the data, such as customer behavior, book trends, revenue, and inventory management, by writing and executing **basic to advanced SQL queries**.

---

## 🧾 Overview  

The project focuses on analyzing data from three main tables **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders** to answer real-world business questions.  
It demonstrates the use of **SQL joins, aggregations, filtering, grouping, and subqueries** to perform complete database analysis.

| Table Name | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **books.csv** | Contains details of all books (Book_ID, Title, Author, Genre, Price, Published_Year, Stock) |
| **customers.csv** | Stores customer information (Customer_ID, Name, City, Country) |
| **orders.csv** | Holds transaction data (Order_ID, Book_ID, Customer_ID, Quantity, Total_Amount, Order_Date) |
